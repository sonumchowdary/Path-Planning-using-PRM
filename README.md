# Path-Planning-using-PRM
Introduction to PRM:
  Among the most efficient methods today, the Probabilistic Roadmap Planner (PRM) is a planner that can compute collision-free paths for robots of virtually any type moving among stationary obstacles (static workspaces). However, PRM is particularly interesting for robots with many dof. 
Aim: 
   To solve the problem of determining a path between a start point of the robot and a goal point while avoiding collisions.
